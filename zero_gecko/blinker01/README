I have an LED on PA0, this blinks it...

"The implementation can include a 24-bit SysTick system timer"

"After reset, the HFRCO frequency is 14 MHz."

There appears to be a systick timer.  With delay(100) which means
100,000,000 clocks per led state change, takes around 7 seconds against
a stopwatch.  100,000,000/14,000,000 = 7.1 and change.  So this all
matches.
