This is USART1 using PC0 as the TX output.

Okay my problems were with the clockdiv register.  It is a strange
one the math for 14Mhz at 115200 comes out to 1688, I assumed that meant
you shifted it left 6.  But it doesnt they want to clip the lower 6 bits
off.  What you/we can do is instead of the 256*(stuff) make it 4*(stuff)
then shift that 6.

So this outputs a 0x55 ('U') at a periodic slow rate on PC0.
