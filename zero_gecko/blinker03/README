I have an LED on PA0, this blinks it...

Simple use of TIMER0.

14,000,000/256 = 54687.5
54687.5/65536 = 0.83 seconds

This uses the overflow interrupt flag, it DOES NOT INTERRUPT THE
ARM CORE.  We are simply polling the flags.

The counter counts from 0x0000 to the TOP register setting (reset
value is 0xFFFF) sets the overflow flag and sets the counter back
to zero, repeat.  We poll the overflow flag, when set set clear it
and toggle the led, repeat.  With the top at the post-reset value
of 0xFFFF the led changes state ever 0.83 seconds.  If we change
the TOP register to a smaller value that will increase the toggle
rate.  Uncomment this line, rebuild and reload.

    //PUT32(TIMER0_TOP,10000-1);
